# Math-Polynom

## Purpose

Math-Polynom is an online tool for mathematicians audience.
The main idea is to provide tool set to operate on polynomials of different kind.

## Features started or planned

The 1st feature is a tool that can raise a polynomial to a power. Like in example below:

    (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2

The 2nd feature is called "Kordano Build" in the name of former mathematician who had last name of Kordano.
He invented the formula below:

    a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3*a*b*c = (a + b + c) * (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)

This formula is important because it creates a door to solve equations of the power of 3 in a common case.
However the idea of that approach can be reused.
